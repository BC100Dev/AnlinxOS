Legend:
[ ] = No development yet
[-] = In Progress
[?] = Unknown State
[X] = Finished
[F] = Finished with caveats (e.g. not fully finished to the needed/wanted desires)
[H] = Halted
[R] = Marked for Removal

##### Current Ideas (Desktop Core, v1) #####
[H] Get initramfs working.
  > Halted for the C++ Extended Library due to reason of getting Kernel module loading working
[-] Get the C++ Extended Library (ALX) working
[-] Have initramfs pass the execution onto the disk.
[ ] Rewrite the libc, merging glibc and bionic into one thing.
[-] Get core components working (rewrite BusyBox).
[ ] Get the necessary parts working (Networking, Audio Server, Bluetooth, Graphics Pipeline, CPU drivers (if necessary), USB I/O).
  > in other words, that's the HAL we are talking about.
  > in the process, make it as generic as possible for portability
  > as for the Networking... this will be a pain in the fucking ass, since we are talking about DHCP, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Security and much more
  > ohboy, thiswillbefun, thisisclearlynotsarcasm, no, notatall
[ ] Get the Wayland Protocol running under the Graphics Pipeline.
  > we are also talking about multi-GPU handling. No idea, whether this will be fun or no
[ ] Get the Desktop Environment running
[ ] Provide compatibility for applications to be able to load older libraries
[ ] Get the Boot Animation playing as part of a MP4 file, allowing frames and audio to be decoded in real time
[ ] Get the OEM logo to show up during the init stages before handing over to boot animation
  > ChatGPT revealed that the OEM logo is exposed via "/sys/firmware/acpi/bgrt/image"

##### PERMISSIONS NEEDED TO INCLUDE #####
[ ] Require apps to always prompt the user into installing applications, both Android and native
[ ] Runtime permission system that is similar to Android
[ ] Require all binaries to have ".prmseq" ELF header
[ ] Provide "clang" and "clang++" compilers for AnlinxOS that require the use of ".prmseq" ELF headers to explicitly require permissions

##### Current Ideas (Mobile Core, stabilized in v5, probably) #####
[ ] Port over the Desktop things to Mobile, effectively taking 6 months or probably more to port... ohgodpleasehelpme-
